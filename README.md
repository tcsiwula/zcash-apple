# Yet Another Zcash Builder for Apple Platform

![Screenshot](https://github.com/kozyilmaz/zcash-apple/raw/master/docs/zcash-apple.png "Zcash on Mac OS")

**This project requires Xcode 9 and a Mac running macOS 10.12.6 or later.**  
This repository builds standalone Zcash binaries for macOS platform without installing brew.  
All build tools (`autoconf, automake, libtool, pkgconfig, cmake, install and readlink`) and `Zcash` are compiled from scratch.  


### Build instructions
```shell
# run once to install Xcode CLI tools
$ xcode-select --install
# clone and build Zcash on macOS
$ git clone https://github.com/kozyilmaz/zcash-apple.git
$ cd zcash-apple
$ source environment
$ make
```

In case of an error please run the following command for debug info
```shell
$ PRINT_DEBUG=y make all
```

After successful build Zcash binaries will be installed to `out` directory under project root  
You can then copy binary directory anywhere you like there are no dependencies to the build tree anymore  
```shell
bash-3.2$ ls -lrt out/usr/local/bin

```

### Run instructions

When launching `Zcash` on MacOS for the first time, certain initalization steps should be completed.  
Please run the commands below once for the first time  

```shell
$ cd out/usr/local/bin

# for testnet
$ ./zcash-fetch-params --testnet

# for mainnet
$ ./zcash-fetch-params

$ ./zcash-init
$ ./zcashd
```

You can just run `Zcash` by launching the daemon afterwards. After blockchain is sync'd, you can use the sample commands provided in [zcash-commands.txt](zcash/files/zcash-commands.txt)  

`$ ./zcashd`  

Console output from the first run is below:
```shell
bash-3.2$ ./zcash-fetch-params
Zcash - fetch-params.sh

This script will fetch the Zcash zkSNARK parameters and verify their
integrity with sha256sum.

If they already exist locally, it will exit now and do nothing else.
The parameters are currently just under 911MB in size, so plan accordingly
for your bandwidth constraints. If the files are already present and
have the correct sha256sum, no networking is used.

Creating params directory. For details about this directory, see:

# excerpted from zclassic/zutil/init-mac.sh

if [ ! -f "$HOME/Library/Application Support/Zcash/zcash.conf" ]; then
    echo "Creating zcash.conf"
    mkdir -p "$HOME/Library/Application Support/Zcash/"
    echo "rpcuser=zcashrpc" > ~/Library/Application\ Support/Zcash/zcash.conf
    PASSWORD=$(cat /dev/urandom | env LC_CTYPE=C tr -dc 'a-zA-Z0-9' | fold -w 32 | head -n 1)
    echo "rpcpassword=$PASSWORD" >> "$HOME/Library/Application Support/Zcash/zcash.conf"
    echo "Complete!"
fi
bash-3.2$ 
bash-3.2$ ./zcash-init 
Creating zcash.conf
Complete!
```

## Running the testnetwork
Modify your ```$HOME/Library/Application\ Support/Zcash/zcash.conf``` file and make sure it looks like this:

``` 
rpcuser=username
rpcpassword=`head -c 32 /dev/urandom | base64`

### connect to test network
testnet=1
addnode=testnet.z.cash
```
You can read more about configs and changing between network [here](https://github
.com/zcash/zcash/blob/master/contrib/debian/examples/zcash.conf) on zcash's example config file.

Now your config is good to go, start the network back up:
``` 
cd $HOME/.zcash/zcash-apple/out/usr/local/bin
./zcashd
```

## See / query which network is running
``` 
cd $HOME/.zcash/zcash-apple/out/usr/local/bin
./zcash-cli getmininginfo
```
should look like this:
``` 
"testnet": true,
  "chain": "test",
```
